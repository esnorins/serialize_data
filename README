serialize_data
--------------
This is a collection of examples of serializing data structures to files and
reading them, in which I practice serialization and deserialization. Currently
only having one project. 

And as of now I'm trying to work on an example for a singly linked list data
structure serialization and deserialization. - 2024.06.04 11:41:55 EEST
