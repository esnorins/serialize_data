serialize_data - list_of_structs
--------------------------------
This direcotry contains an exmaple for serialization and deserialization of a
list of structs. (You could call it an array of structs. ) The `N` could also
be a value gotten in runtime, but for sake of example I didn't add that
functionality.

A problem in this is that this approach of storing data requires a continuous
array of dynamic memory to be allocated, which could not be available if there
is enough data.
